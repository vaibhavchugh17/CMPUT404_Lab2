Question 1
You can specify a TCP socket in python using socket.socket() method. The first argument is the address family. socket.AF_INET is the 
address family for IPv4. The second argument is the socket type. For TCP we can use socket.SOCK_STREAM. 

Question 2
As we can see from the code in client.py, a client socket needs to connect to a particular IP address of a host and a port over which
it can send HTTP requests and receive back data.
A server socket on the other hand needs to bound a host to port where it can listen for connections and accept them. It can be
connected to any IP address and receive data from them as well as send data back.

Question 3
We can use sock.setsockopt() and argument SO_REUSEADDR to instruct the OS that allows us to reuse the same port number over and over again. 
Without it, we'd have to wait for the OS to release the port before we could reuse it.

Question 4
We know the IP address of the incoming connections when we accept it using sock.accept() method

Question 5
After the client sends a HTTP request, using recv() it receives back the data send by the server. In our case, this data is the same
data we send to the server, hence the name echo_server.
